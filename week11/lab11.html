			  Unless otherwise specified, for each of the following questions, provide the following information:  Network numbers, subnet masks, broadcast addresses, and number of hosts and networks.  
			  <ol>
				  <li>(2 points)Given the network 194.224.17.0, divide it such that there are 8 networks.   </li>
				  <br><p>
				  <li>(2 points) Given the network 10.10.0.0, divide it such that there are 64 networks   </li>
				  <br><p>
				  <li>(2 points) Divide the network 172.19.0.0. so that there are at least 900 machines on each network.   </li>
				  <br><p>
				  <li>(2 points) Given the C class address 198.22.77.0, and the requirement of  700 hosts per network, how many additional addresses will be necessary, and what will all the other network information look like?  </li>
				  <br><p>
				  <li>(4 points)Your client needs at least 16 networks of 128 machines each.  Give them an address under the 10. network that fills this requirement, and show all relevant information. </li>
				  <br><p>
				  <li> (2 points)Your network number is 10.14.0.0, and your subnet mask is 255.255.192.0.  How many networks do you have, and how many hosts per network?   </li>
				  <br><p>
				  <li>(2 points)If you added two more bits to the subnet mask from the question above, what would the networks look like?   </li>
